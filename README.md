## üß© About `native_app/`

The `native_app/` folder contains a Python script and a manifest for the **Native Messaging host** that integrates with the Chrome extension to enable features that require deeper system access, such as:

- Accessing file system beyond browser limitations
- Advanced duplicate detection or auto-delete features

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
- The native app requires **separate installation** on your system.
- It must be registered with your OS for Chrome‚Äôs Native Messaging to communicate with it.
- See [Google‚Äôs official Native Messaging docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/nativeMessaging/) for setup details.
